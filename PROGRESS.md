# Progress — Trust The Process (TTP)

Phases from SPEC §9. ✅ = built and verified on desktop (mobile viewport); 📱 = confirmed on iPhone.
Live URL: https://crusaderrrr.github.io/

## Decisions
- 2026-10-22 — Hevy-style logging: per-set ✓ completion, Previous column, rest timer, live duration.
- 2026-10-22 — Edit/delete finished workouts in v1.
- 2026-10-22 — History tab in v1.
- 2026-10-22 — Set types now: normal / warmup / drop / failure (`set_type`).
- 2026-10-22 — Hosted as user site `Crusaderrrr.github.io` → base `/`.
- 2026-10-22 — Build all phases continuously; owner tests on iPhone and sends corrections.

## Phase 0 — Skeleton + persistence gate ✅ 📱
- [x] Repo, Pages via GitHub Actions, Vite/React/TS/Tailwind, HashRouter, tab bar
- [x] DB worker (`opfs-sahpool`, pool `ttp`) + RPC + migration 1, "open elsewhere" screen
- [x] `domain/dates.ts` + tests, PWA config, deploy workflow
- [x] iPhone: installed, launch counter persists

## Phase 1 — Exercise library ✅
- [x] List + search + muscle-group filter
- [x] Add custom exercise (also from the workout picker)
- [x] Archive (history) / hard-delete (custom, no history); archived list + unarchive

## Phase 2 — Backup ✅
- [x] Export (share sheet on iOS / download elsewhere) as `ttp-YYYY-MM-DD.sqlite3`
- [x] Import with header + `user_version` validation, migrate-forward, reload
- [x] Last-backup date + 14-day nudge (Settings and Today); storage status, build time

## Phase 3 — Workout logging ✅
- [x] `domain/sets.ts` + `domain/workout.ts` + tests
- [x] Start / continue / discard; mini-bar while in progress; minimize
- [x] Multi-select exercise picker; remove / move / replace exercises
- [x] Set table: SET · PREVIOUS · KG · REPS · ✓, set types, swipe/menu delete, add set (pre-fill)
- [x] Rest timer (per-exercise setting, persisted `rest_ends_at`, ±15 s, skip, beep + flash)
- [x] Live duration, volume, set count header
- [x] Finish flow (incomplete-sets prompt, save sheet with summary + PR count)

## Phase 4 — History + edit/delete ✅
- [x] History cards (duration, volume, PRs, exercises) + detail
- [x] Edit finished workout (title, date, start time, minutes, notes, sets)
- [x] Delete workout

## Phase 5 — Plan + calendar + skips ✅
- [x] `plan_version` + Plan screen
- [x] `domain/calendar.ts` + tests
- [x] Month grid (arrows + swipe), day sheet, skip with reason, log past workout
- [x] Missed-days banner on Today (last 14 days); month summary + reasons

## Phase 6 — Progress ✅
- [x] `domain/progress.ts` + tests
- [x] Charts (top weight, e1RM, volume) with 1M / 3M / 1Y / All
- [x] PR cards, session history

## Feedback round 1 (2026-10-22) ✅
- [x] Gap between the workout header and the first exercise
- [x] Log Workout header pinned (header outside the scrolling body)
- [x] Rest timer Skip button green
- [x] Set-type menu: first item no longer clipped; W / D / F letters in yellow / blue / red
- [x] Favourite exercises (★) + Favourites section in Exercises and the picker (migration 2)
- [x] Muscle-group icons on exercises (drawn SVG per muscle group; no image column needed)
- [x] **Data-loss fix**: `preserveOnInitFailure: true` (see SPEC §7)

## Feedback round 2 (2026-10-22) ✅
- [x] Exercise photos (free-exercise-db, public domain) for all 52 seed exercises, bundled offline
- [x] Own photo for any exercise (new-exercise sheet + progress page), stored in DB (migration 3)
- [x] Hevy-style illustrations need a paid license — not used (owner chose free photos)
- [x] DB install retries; stress-tested close→reopen cycles and tab takeover without data loss

## Feedback round 3 (2026-10-22) ✅
- [x] Pages no longer rubber-band off-screen on iOS (document pinned; only content scrolls)
- [x] Grip selector (wide / normal / narrow / parallel wide / parallel normal) on grip exercises,
      remembered per exercise, matched in Previous, shown in History, filterable in Progress
- [x] Bottom sheets portal to <body> so the tab bar can't cover them on iOS
- [x] UI redesign: Material Symbols (filled) icons everywhere, cards, page headers, grouped
      Settings rows, Today week strip + last workout, floating rest bar, area chart with metric tabs

## Feedback round 4 (2026-10-22) ✅
- [x] Settings → Default rest timer, applied to every exercise not customised in a workout
      (migration 5); workout rest menu gains "Use default"

## Feedback round 5 (2026-10-23) ✅
- [x] Treadmill exercise: time / speed / incline sets instead of kg / reps (migration 6)

## Feedback round 6 (2026-10-24) ✅
- [x] Red delete background no longer bleeds through set rows (only mounted while swiped)
- [x] Rest-timer end: screen flash removed (beep kept; there were no other sounds)
- [x] Weight/reps auto-propagate to later incomplete sets; dimmed until edited/completed (migration 7)
- [x] Tonnage chart (per week / per workout) on History; ranges 1M / 3M / 1Y / 3Y; per-exercise charts use the same ranges
- [x] Reorder exercises: drag-and-drop sheet (replaces Move up/down)
- [x] Per-session exercise note (migration 7); shown in History detail and the calendar day sheet
- Notifications: options discussed in chat, not implemented

## v2 self-hosted full-stack (branch `fullstack`, see `MIGRATION.md`)
### Phase 7 — Server skeleton ✅
- [x] Hono + postgres.js server (`server/`), migrations runner (`schema_migrations`, advisory lock, one transaction)
- [x] `001_init.sql`: `app_user`, `session`, `invite`, `user_settings`
- [x] Serves the built SPA (hashed assets immutable, rest `no-cache`), `/api/health`, JSON 404 under `/api`
- [x] `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml` (Postgres internal only, app on 127.0.0.1:3000), `compose.dev.yml` (`npm run db:dev`, port 5433)
- [x] CI (`ci.yml`) on `fullstack` + PRs with a Postgres service; server tests need `npm run db:dev` locally

### Phase 8 — Accounts ✅
- [x] Invite-only sign-up (single-use codes, atomic with user creation), login, logout, `GET /api/auth/me`
- [x] argon2id passwords; sessions = random token in HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax cookie, only SHA-256 stored, 30-day sliding expiry
- [x] Rate limit 10 / 15 min per client + username (sign-up per client); JSON-only guard for writes (CSRF); 2 MB body limit; CSP + security headers
- [x] Owner CLI: `docker compose exec app node dist-server/cli.js invite [count]` / `users`
- [x] Login / sign-up screen as a gate around the app; Settings → Account (signed in as, log out)
- [x] E2E in Chrome (390×844) against the real server under the CSP: bad invite, sign-up, reload keeps session, logout
- [x] Owner = first account (`is_admin`, migration 002). Settings → **Invite a friend** mints a single-use code as a sign-up link (`/#/signup?invite=…` prefills the form); Share sheet on iOS, copy elsewhere. The very first invite still comes from the CLI.

### Phase 9 — API + client ✅
- [x] Migration 003: `exercise`, `workout` / `workout_exercise` / `workout_set` (client UUIDs), `plan_version` / `plan_day`, `skip`; every row owned by a user; seed library (53 exercises) copied per account at sign-up
- [x] Endpoints: exercises (CRUD, patch, previous), settings, plan, skips, workouts (a workout is one document: `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/workouts/:id`, `/active`, calendar range), history, progress sessions; all filtered by the session's user
- [x] Client: repositories call the API; workout edits are pure functions in `domain/workoutDoc.ts` (tested) applied to a cached document and saved whole, one request at a time (`repositories/workoutStore.ts`)
- [x] `src/db/` (SQLite worker) is no longer loaded; kept only so phase 11 can read a v1 backup. Export/import-database UI, "App launches" and the backup nudge are gone
- [x] E2E in Chrome: sign-up → start → add exercises → sets with auto-fill → reload mid-workout → finish (PR count) → history, tonnage chart, progress page → second workout shows Previous

### Phase 10 — Local-first active workout ✅
- [x] `repositories/workoutStore.ts`: edits apply to the cached document instantly and are mirrored to `localStorage` (`ttp:pending:<id>`); the whole document is PUT after a 1 s debounce, retried with backoff (2 s … 30 s) while the network/server fails, flushed on background / `pagehide` / `online`; copies left in storage are re-saved on the next launch. Last write wins
- [x] "Offline — changes will sync" banner while a save is failing (`App.tsx`, `useSyncFailing`)
- [x] E2E in Chrome (390×844): go offline → fill set + mark done → banner shows, copy in localStorage → back online → synced, banner and copy gone; a stale pending copy is saved on reload
- Not covered: adding/replacing an exercise offline (needs the exercise list + "Previous" from the server); a 4xx refusal drops the local copy

### Phase 11 — Import a v1 backup ✅ (UI not yet clicked through in a browser)
- [x] `POST /api/import` (`server/routes/import.ts`, 20 MB body limit for this route only): one transaction; settings, exercises (matched by name to the account's library, custom ones created), workouts, plan, skips. Ids derive from (account, v1 id), so importing the same file again replaces instead of duplicating. The backup's unfinished workout is left out if the account already has one in progress. Tests in `import.test.ts`
- [x] `src/db/v1reader.worker.ts` reads the `.sqlite3` in memory with sqlite-wasm (no migration, so any v1 schema version 1–7 works) and builds the JSON; Settings → Data → **Import a v1 backup**
- [x] Checked with the real backup (`ttp-2026-10-25.sqlite3`, v7): reader output posted to a real server twice → 1 workout, plan Mon–Fri, skip 22 Oct, default rest 180 s, 3 favourites, no duplicates
- [ ] Click-through of the file picker in a browser (Chrome tool was unavailable)

## Not verified yet
- iPhone check of Phases 1–6 (owner).
- Rest-timer beep on iOS (Web Audio is muted while the ringer switch is on silent).
- Missed-day banner end-to-end (needs a plan older than the missed day; logic is unit tested).
